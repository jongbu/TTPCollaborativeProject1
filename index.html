			<p>Food rescue does not involve superheroes in capes. Also called food recovery, it is the recovered applespractice of retrieving edible food that would otherwise </br>
				go to waste and distributing it to those in need. In most cases, the recovered food is perfectly edible, but not sellable. For example, it’s day old bread or bagged </br>
				lettuce past its “sell-by” date. Often, it’s in great shape.</p>
			<p>The food that recovery agencies pick up is donated by supermarkets, restaurants and farms. In most cases, the rescued food is being saved from the dumpster and, ultimately, </br>
				the landfill. Food recovered on farms is kept from being plowed under. On farms, the donations often must be harvested, or gleaned, by volunteers.</p>
			<p>If you’re a restaurant, supermarket supervisor or farmer who doesn’t enjoy throwing away food, there’s probably a food recovery organization near you willing to pick up your </br>
				extras. Please contact us through 1-800-GLEAN-IT to find assistance in finding food recovery agencies.</p>
